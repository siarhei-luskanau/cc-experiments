In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request.

Multiple Q&A rounds clarified: total reading time metric, username-only identity, free-text book titles, one active session at a time, global leaderboard, daily/weekly/monthly/all-time windows, real-time WebSocket updates, Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose, Compose Multiplatform UI.\n\n2. **PLAN.md Creation**: Created comprehensive plan at `/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/PLAN.md` covering architecture, tech stack, DB schema, REST API, DTOs, client screens, Docker Compose, implementation phases.\n\n3. **Phase 1 Implementation**: User requested implementing Phase 1 — Backend Foundation following the orchestrator-workflow skill's 5-phase flow.\n\n4. **5-Phase Execution for Phase 1**:\n   - Phase 1 (Assessment): Read existing files\n   - Phase 2 (Research): Web researcher couldn't access web but provided code patterns\n   - Phase 3 (Planning): Defined execution groups\n   - Phase 4 (Execution): \n     - G1: Project skeleton (settings.gradle.kts, build.gradle.kts, docker-compose.yml, shared-dto module, backend scaffold, Flyway migration)\n     - G2A/B/C parallel: User domain, Session domain, Leaderboard+config domains\n     - G3: Integration tests\n   - Phase 5 (Validation): Senior validator found CRITICAL (durationSec null due to L1 cache), MAJOR (LeaderboardRepository extends JpaRepository unnecessarily, startedAt stale), MINOR (@JvmField missing). All fixed.\n\n5. **TOML Catalog Migration**: User requested converting Gradle project to use TOML version catalog, referencing https://github.com/siarhei-luskanau/spring-boot-sql-kotlin-sample as example. Followed 5-phase workflow:\n   - Research: Fetched reference repo's libs.versions.toml and build files\n   - Created `gradle/libs.versions.toml`\n   - Updated all 3 build.gradle.kts files\n   - Validation: Validator flagged false positive (libs.kotlinx.serialization.json is correct - dashes become dots for library accessors, not camelCase)\n\nKey technical decisions:\n- Package: `com.bookreads`\n- Spring Boot 3.3.5, Kotlin 2.1.0\n- EntityManager.refresh() after flush for generated columns\n- LeaderboardRepository extends Repository<ReadingSession, Long> (not JpaRepository)\n- @JvmField on Testcontainers companion object\n- TOML: only kotlinx-serialization-json in [libraries]; BOM-managed deps stay as strings\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Create a project plan for a Book Reading Leaderboard app (saved to `PLAN.md`), with requirements gathered via Q&A: total reading time metric, username-only identity, free-text book title, one active session per user, global leaderboard, daily/weekly/monthly/all-time windows, real-time WebSocket, Spring Boot + Kotlin backend, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose deployment, Compose Multiplatform UI (Android/iOS/JVM/WasmJS).\n   - Implement Phase 1 — Backend Foundation: Gradle monorepo, shared-dto module, backend module (Spring Boot 3, JPA, Flyway, WebSocket, Security), Flyway migrations, User/Session/Leaderboard domains, Docker Compose, integration tests with Testcontainers.\n   - Migrate the Gradle project to use a TOML version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`), following the pattern from https://github.com/siarhei-luskanau/spring-boot-sql-kotlin-sample.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Gradle Kotlin DSL multi-module project (root + `backend` + `shared-dto`)\n   - Gradle version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`) with `[versions]`, `[libraries]`, `[plugins]` sections\n   - TOML accessor rules: library dashes → dots (`kotlinx-serialization-json` → `libs.kotlinx.serialization.json`); version dashes → camelCase (`java-language-version` → `libs.versions.javaLanguageVersion`)\n   - Spring Boot 3.3.5 + Kotlin 2.1.0\n   - Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL `GENERATED ALWAYS AS STORED` computed columns\n   - Hibernate L1 cache problem: `findById()` after `flush()` returns cached entity — must use `entityManager.refresh()` to get DB-computed values\n   - Spring Data `Repository<T, ID>` marker interface (vs full `JpaRepository`) for read-only query repos\n   - Testcontainers `@ServiceConnection` + `@JvmField` on companion object for Spring Boot 3.1+ integration tests\n   - Flyway migrations with `flyway-database-postgresql` separate artifact (required Flyway 10+)\n   - Spring WebSocket raw (non-STOMP) handler via `WebSocketConfigurer`\n   - `@Transactional` + `EntityManager` injection in Spring services\n   - kotlinx.serialization `@Serializable` DTOs in `shared-dto`\n   - Spring Security 6.x — CSRF disabled, all requests permitted\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/PLAN.md`** — Full project plan including architecture, tech stack, DB schema, REST API, DTOs, implementation phases.

now uses `entityManager.refresh(session)` after `flush()` in both `startSession` and `endSession`:\n     ```kotlin\n     @Service\n     class SessionService(\n         private val sessionRepository: SessionRepository,\n         private val userRepository: UserRepository,\n         private val entityManager: jakarta.persistence.EntityManager\n     ) {\n         @Transactional\n         fun startSession(username: String, bookTitle: String): SessionDto {\n             // ... check user, check no active session ...\n             val session = sessionRepository.save(ReadingSession(user = user, bookTitle = bookTitle))\n             sessionRepository.flush()\n             entityManager.refresh(session)\n             return session.toDto()\n         }\n         @Transactional\n         fun endSession(username: String): SessionDto {\n             // ... find active session, set endedAt ...\n             sessionRepository.save(session)\n             sessionRepository.flush()\n             entityManager.refresh(session)\n             return session.toDto()\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/backend/src/main/kotlin/com/bookreads/leaderboard/LeaderboardRepository.kt`** (PATCHED) — Changed from `JpaRepository<ReadingSession, Long>` to `Repository<ReadingSession, Long>`:\n     ```kotlin\n     interface LeaderboardRepository : Repository<ReadingSession, Long> {\n         @Query(value = \"\"\"\n             SELECT u.username AS username,\n                    SUM(COALESCE(s.duration_sec, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - s.started_at))::BIGINT)) AS total_sec,\n                    COUNT(s.id) AS session_count\n             FROM reading_sessions s JOIN users u ON u.id = s.user_id\n             WHERE s.started_at >= :windowStart\n             GROUP BY u.id, u.username ORDER BY total_sec DESC\n         \"\"\", nativeQuery = true)\n         fun findLeaderboard(@Param(\"windowStart\") windowStart: Instant): List<LeaderboardRow>\n     }\n     interface LeaderboardRow { val username: String; val totalSec: Long; val sessionCount: Int }\n     ```\n\n   - **`/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/backend/src/test/kotlin/com/bookreads/BaseIntegrationTest.kt`** (PATCHED) — Added `@JvmField`:\n     ```kotlin\n     companion object {\n         @JvmField\n         @Container\n         @ServiceConnection\n         val postgres: PostgreSQLContainer<*> = PostgreSQLContainer(\"postgres:16-alpine\")\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql`** — Flyway migration creating `users` and `reading_sessions` tables with `duration_sec GENERATED ALWAYS AS STORED`.\n   - **`/Users/se/git/cc-experiments/docker-compose.yml`** — PostgreSQL 16 + backend with healthcheck.\n   - **DTOs in `shared-dto/src/main/kotlin/com/bookreads/dto/`**: `UserDto`, `SessionDto`, `LeaderboardEntryDto`, `LeaderboardUpdateMessage` — all `@Serializable`.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Hibernate L1 cache — `durationSec` always null**: `endSession` used `findById()` after `flush()` which returns cached entity. Fixed by injecting `EntityManager` and calling `entityManager.refresh(session)` in both `startSession` and `endSession`.\n   - **`LeaderboardRepository` extends `JpaRepository` unnecessarily**: Exposes unwanted CRUD. Fixed by changing to `Repository<ReadingSession, Long>`.\n   - **Missing `@JvmField` on Testcontainers companion**: Testcontainers JUnit Jupiter extension finds containers via reflection. Fixed by adding `@JvmField`.\n   - **`startSession` returned stale `startedAt`**: `started_at` is `insertable=false`, set by DB. Fixed with same `flush()` + `entityManager.refresh()` pattern for consistency.\n   - **Validator false positive on `libs.kotlinx.serialization.json`**: Validator incorrectly said the accessor should be `libs.kotlinxSerializationJson`. Confirmed correct Gradle behavior: library dashes → dots (not camelCase). Reference repo confirms `apache-commons-csv` → `libs.apache.commons.csv`. Current code is correct.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Resolved Hibernate generated-column refresh by using `EntityManager.refresh()` post-flush rather than `findById()` which hits L1 cache.\n   - Confirmed TOML library accessor convention (dashes → dots) via reference repo evidence, overriding incorrect validator claim.\n   - All Phase 1 checklist items completed and validated.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Create a project plan of a software product and save the plan to the project directory. The product should show a leaderboard of book reading. User should be able to make an action 'start book reading' and 'end book reading'. We need a backend (Gradle/Kotlin) and KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform) clients with JVM, Android, iOS, and WasmJs targets. Ask questions until all requirements are clear.\"\n   - [Q&A answers]: Total reading time, Simple username, Free-text title, Global only, Real-time WebSocket, One session at a time, Daily/weekly/monthly/all-time, Local/Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Compose Multiplatform, Spring Boot.\n   - \"Implement Phase 1 — Backend Foundation\"\n   - [task-notification messages — late-arriving agent completions, no new requests]\n   - \"Update gradle project to use TOML catalog. See example here https://github.com/siarhei-luskanau/spring-boot-sql-kotlin-sample\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Phase 2 — Real-time Broadcast (WebSocket `LeaderboardWebSocketHandler`, broadcast on session change)\n   - Phase 3 — KMP Client Scaffold\n   - Phase 4 — Compose Multiplatform UI\n   - Phase 5 — Platform Entry Points\n   - Phase 6 — Polish & Packaging\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Migrated the Gradle project from hardcoded version strings to a TOML version catalog following the reference repo pattern. Created `gradle/libs.versions.toml` with 5 versions, 1 library (`kotlinx-serialization-json`), and 6 plugins. Updated all 3 `build.gradle.kts` files to use `alias(libs.plugins.xxx)` for plugins and `libs.kotlinx.serialization.json` for the serialization library. BOM-managed dependencies (Spring starters, Flyway, PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, Jackson, kotlin-reflect) remain as plain strings. Validation passed — a validator false positive about the library accessor was correctly identified and dismissed based on reference repo evidence.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The TOML catalog migration is complete and validated. The most recent explicit user request was \"Update gradle project to use TOML catalog\" which is now done. No next step was specified by the user. The logical continuation from the plan would be Phase 2 — Real-time Broadcast, but this should be confirmed with the user before starting.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1827,"cache_read_input_tokens":166495,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1827},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYFk2h7Amf1VnQk6jbdu7","type":"assistant","uuid":"3cc4a1f1-5ff8-467a-b652-45cec21487b2","timestamp":"2026-02-18T15:07:56.374Z"}
