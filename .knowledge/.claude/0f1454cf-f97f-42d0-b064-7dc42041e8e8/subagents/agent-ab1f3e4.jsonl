I need to be transparent with you about this limitation.\n\n---\n\nI cannot complete this research task as requested. Both the WebSearch and WebFetch tools — which are essential for researching Spring Boot 4.0.x since it was released after my knowledge cutoff — have been denied in this environment.\n\nHere is what I know with confidence (from my training data up to August 2025), and where I must flag uncertainty:\n\n---\n\n## What I Know Confidently (Spring Boot 3.x baseline)\n\n**Spring Boot 3.x Gradle dependencies for Kotlin** (the last confirmed stable before my cutoff):\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.springframework.boot\") version \"3.x.x\"\n    id(\"io.spring.dependency-management\") version \"1.1.x\"\n    kotlin(\"jvm\") version \"2.x.x\"\n    kotlin(\"plugin.spring\") version \"2.x.x\"\n    kotlin(\"plugin.jpa\") version \"2.x.x\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa\")\n    implementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web\")\n    implementation(\"org.flywaydb:flyway-core\")\n    implementation(\"org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql\") // separate since Flyway 10\n    runtimeOnly(\"org.postgresql:postgresql\")\n    testImplementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test\")\n    testImplementation(\"org.testcontainers:postgresql\")\n}\n```\n\n**Virtual threads (Spring Boot 3.2+):**\n```yaml\nspring:\n  threads:\n    virtual:\n      enabled: true\n```\n\n**Flyway:** Since Flyway 10 (which Spring Boot 3.2+ manages), `flyway-database-postgresql` IS a separate dependency from `flyway-core`.\n\n**Testcontainers BOM:** Spring Boot 3.x manages Testcontainers via its dependency management BOM — you do not need to declare a version explicitly when using the Spring dependency management plugin.\n\n**kotlinx-serialization:** As of Spring Boot 3.x, there is no native `spring-boot-starter` that switches the default JSON library to kotlinx-serialization. Jackson remains the default. You must manually register a `KotlinSerializationJsonHttpMessageConverter`. There is no `spring-boot-starter-json` variant for kotlinx-serialization in the official Spring starters.\n\n---\n\n## What I Cannot Confirm for Spring Boot 4.0.x\n\nSpring Boot 4.0 (based on Spring Framework 7) had not been released as of my August 2025 knowledge cutoff, or was very recently in pre-release. I cannot reliably confirm:\n\n1. Whether the plugin version, BOM version, or any artifact coordinates changed for 4.0\n2. Whether virtual threads configuration changed (the property may be the same or removed if virtual threads became the default)\n3. Whether Spring Boot 4 added native kotlinx-serialization starter support\n4. Exact Testcontainers BOM version managed by Spring Boot 4\n5. Any Spring Framework 7 API changes that affect the Kotlin plugin requirements\n\n---\n\n## What You Should Do\n\nTo get accurate Spring Boot 4.0.x information, please enable the web research tools (WebSearch and WebFetch) and re-run this query. The authoritative sources to check are:\n\n- **Release notes:** `https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.0-Release-Notes`\n- **Reference docs:** `https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/4.0.x/reference/html/`\n- **Dependency versions BOM:** `https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/4.0.x/reference/html/dependency-versions.html`\n- **Spring Initializr** (generates a working build.gradle.kts): `https://start.spring.io`\n- **Migration guide:** `https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.0-Migration-Guide`\n\nThese sources will give you exact artifact coordinates and confirmed configuration properties for Spring Boot 4.0.x that I cannot safely fabricate from inference."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":622,"cache_read_input_tokens":5405,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":622},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYHR1tDBR7orqYQfTdvcV","type":"assistant","uuid":"ee757621-4a0a-42ce-99bf-aa372583383c","timestamp":"2026-02-19T12:18:57.305Z"}
